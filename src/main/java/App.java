Exercise 23 - Troubleshooting Car Issues
An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car.

Example Output
Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
The battery cables may be damaged.
Replace cables and try again.

Constraint
Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.
